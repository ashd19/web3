1] Oracles are services that feed external (off-chain) data into the blockchain (on-chain) so that smart contracts can use real-world information.
2] Ethereum smart contracts are deterministic — they only know about on-chain data (balances, transactions, contract state).
But many use cases need real-world inputs like:

The current ETH/USD price

Sports match results

Weather data (for crop insurance)

Proof that a package was delivered

Since Ethereum nodes can’t just “fetch” from the internet (that would break consensus), they rely on oracles.
3]   How Oracles Work

A smart contract on Ethereum requests data.

The oracle service fetches the data from external APIs / IoT devices / other blockchains.

The oracle posts that data on-chain, so the smart contract can use it. 

4] Examples in Ethereum

Chainlink → The most popular decentralized oracle network (price feeds, randomness, cross-chain bridges).

Band Protocol, API3, Pyth → Other oracle providers.

VRF (Verifiable Random Function) from Chainlink → Provides on-chain randomness (used in games, lotteries).
